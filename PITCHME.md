# Bacon

### Ingredients

- 1 3-5 pound pork belly slab with the skin still on
- 1/4 cup (50 grams) [basic dry cure](basic_dry_cure.md)
- 1/2 cup (125 grams) brown sugar

---

### Preperation

- Place pork belly, cure, sugar and any additional seasonings in a Ziploc bag. Seal and shake to distribute ingredients.
- Refrigerate the belly for 7 days. Flip the bag every other day to redistribute the cure.
- Once firm, remove belly from cure, rinse thoroughly, and pat dry with paper towels. Refrigerate on a rack over a baking sheet for 12-36 hours or until a nice pellicle forms.

---

- Hot smoke to a temperature of 150 degrees F./65 degrees C.
- When cool enough to handle but still warm, cut skin off leaving as much fat on the bacon as possible. (Or leave the skin on for "rind on bacon"). Skin can be cut up and used in soups or stews or can be used to make pork rinds.

Yield: 2-4 pounds of smoked slab bacon
